## What's New in v2.0?

Filedrop v2.0 is a complete security and architecture overhaul, transforming the tool from a simple HTTP server into a cryptographically sound, DDoS-resistant, zero-knowledge transfer protocol. 

*   **Fragment Crypto:** Files are dynamically encrypted on your Mac using military-grade **AES-256-GCM** before they ever hit the network. The decryption key is generated locally and injected directly into the QR code's URL fragment (`#key`). Because browsers never send the `#` fragment over the network, anyone sniffing your Wi-Fi (even at a public coffee shop) sees nothing but encrypted binary garbage.
*   **Ephemeral URLs:** The download path is completely randomized per session (e.g., `/download/08da0a41...`). Attackers cannot blindly scrape or guess the file location.
*   **DDoS Protection:** Built-in IP rate limiter automatically blocks connections that send more than 30 requests in 10 seconds, preventing local scripts from crashing your Node process.
*   **Path Traversal Immunity:** The server rigorously ignores URL path manipulations, making it mathematically impossible to access out-of-scope files like `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Next-Gen Browser UX:** The browser interface now uses `ReadableStream` to display a beautiful, native progress bar during the download. Once the decryption finishes, the tab automatically closes itself.

## Install

```sh
# npm (recommended)
npm install -g @dreamstick/filedrop

# npx (no install)
npx @dreamstick/filedrop ./photo.jpg
```

## Usage

```sh
filedrop ./photo.jpg         # serve an image
filedrop ./report.pdf        # serve a document
filedrop ./video.mp4 -m      # serve and broadcast via mDNS
```

## How it works

1.  **Server**: Binds to a local port, generates a secure AES key, and begins serving your file.
2.  **QR**: Renders a high-contrast terminal QR code for instantaneous scanning.
3.  **Transfer**: Your phone connects, downloads the encrypted blob, and decrypts it locally in the browser using the key from the URL fragment.
4.  **Auto-terminate**: Automatically shuts down and exits after a single successful transfer.

## Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-p, --port <n>` | Specific port to bind (default: auto 8000-8999) |
| `-m, --mdns` | Broadcast the file over the local network via mDNS |
| `-t, --timeout <s>` | Seconds to wait for a connection (default: 300) |
| `--no-qr` | Suppress QR code, print URL only |
| `--qr-compact` | Print QR code without surrounding metadata box |
| `--color <color>` | Override terminal theme color (e.g., cyan, red, green) |
| `--verbose, -v` | Verbose output (log all decisions) |
| `--version` | Print version and exit |
| `--help, -h` | Print help and exit |

## FAQ

**My phone can't connect**
Make sure both your computer and phone are on the exact same Wi-Fi network and subnet. If you have an active VPN, try disabling it. Alternatively, use the `-m` flag to enable mDNS auto-discovery.

**Is this secure on public Wi-Fi?**
Yes! Because of the new Fragment Crypto architecture in v2.0, the file is entirely encrypted using AES-256-GCM. The decryption key is only passed via the QR code and is never transmitted to the server. Even if someone intercepts your traffic on a public network, they cannot read the file.

**What happened to the PIN codes?**
PIN codes have been fully deprecated and removed in v2.0. The new Fragment Crypto system is mathematically superior and completely invisible to the user, meaning you no longer have to manually type a PIN into your phone.

**Can I serve a directory?**
No, `@dreamstick/filedrop` is strictly for transferring single files. If you need to transfer a directory, create a zip archive first.
